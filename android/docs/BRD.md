## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Parents face a fundamental challenge with YouTube: the platform's recommendation algorithm and vast content library make it impossible to ensure children only watch age-appropriate content. Existing parental controls (YouTube Kids, Restricted Mode) use automated filtering that is unreliable — inappropriate content regularly bypasses these filters, while safe educational content is often incorrectly blocked.

### Solution

**YouTubeWhitelist** is a free, open-source Android application that gives parents complete control over what YouTube content their children can access. Instead of relying on automated filters, parents manually curate a whitelist of specific channels, videos, and playlists. Children see only this curated content — nothing else.

### Value Proposition

| For | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Parents** | Peace of mind — children can only watch content the parent has explicitly approved |
| **Children** | Safe, distraction-free YouTube experience with familiar content |
| **Privacy-conscious users** | 100% client-side, no data collection, no tracking, open-source |
| **Cost-conscious users** | Completely free, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases |

## 2. Business Objectives

| ID | Objective | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| **BO-01** | Safe YouTube environment | Ensure children can only access parent-approved YouTube content |
| **BO-02** | Full parental control | Give parents granular control over content, time limits, and usage monitoring |
| **BO-03** | Privacy-first design | No data leaves the device — no analytics, no tracking, no backend server |
| **BO-04** | Free and open-source | GPLv3 license, no monetization through user data or subscriptions |
| **BO-05** | Platform independence | No dependency on Google Play Services SDK — works on F-Droid and de-Googled devices |

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary: Parents with children aged 3–12

- **Demographics**: Parents, guardians, caregivers of young children
- **Technical level**: Basic smartphone users — no technical expertise required
- **Motivation**: Want children to enjoy YouTube safely without constant supervision
- **Pain points**: YouTube Kids filtering is unreliable; YouTube's algorithm recommends unsuitable content; no way to create a truly custom safe space

### Secondary: Educators and childcare providers

- **Use case**: Classroom or daycare settings where specific educational YouTube content is needed
- **Motivation**: Curate educational playlists per child/group
- **Pain points**: Cannot control what YouTube shows after the intended video ends

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| YouTube Data API v3 quota: 10,000 units/day | Limits number of API calls | Hybrid strategy: oEmbed/RSS free endpoints for most operations; kid search is local-only (0 quota); Invidious fallback; built-in API key |
| Google blocks OAuth in embedded WebViews | Cannot use WebView for sign-in | Chrome Custom Tabs (standard browser approach) |
| YouTube IFrame Player API for playback | No native player control | JavaScript bridges for player events |
| No backend server | No push notifications, no cloud sync | All data local; export/import for data portability |
| F-Droid prohibits non-free dependencies | Cannot use Google Play Services SDK | Custom OAuth implementation with Chrome Custom Tabs |

### Assumptions

| Assumption | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Parents set up the app locally on the device | No Google account and no OAuth sign-in required |
| Device has internet access for initial setup and content resolution | API calls required to fetch YouTube metadata |
| Parents will manually curate content | Core design philosophy — no automated recommendations |
| Content is relatively stable | Whitelist items reference YouTube IDs which rarely change |
